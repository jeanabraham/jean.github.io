title: How to setup (EAP 6 on Mac OS X) + (Oracle XE on RHEL 7 VM)
---

Oracle 11g XE does not run natively on Mac OS X. However, you can have it setup running on a VM and have your natively-running JBoss servers connect to it via port-forwarding (along with additional steps below):

* Install EAP 6.x on Mac OS X
* Install RHEL 7.x as a VM using Virtual Box
* Install Oracle 11g XE on RHEL 7.x
* Create DB users on Oracle DB server
* Add [port forwarding](https://blogs.oracle.com/opal/entry/the_easiest_way_to_enable) for Oracle DB’s default ‘1521’
* [Turn off firewall](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-stop-start-and-disable-enable-firewall-on-redhat-7-linux-system) on RHEL 7 and [disable SELinux](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-sel-enable-disable.html). Presumably, you don’t need such lockdown features when running locally. If needed, grant appropriate firewall permissions for ip/port. Otherwise, you can permanently disable the firewall service:
```
service firewalld stop
chkconfig firewalld off
```
