title: What makes a good Engineer?
---

An [insightful interview with Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE) reveals that good engineers:

* are more concerned with fixing problems than necessarily dreaming or envisioning an idea that will change the world
* are stubborn; refuse to give up on the problem they are working on
* are tasteful, and have an intuitive understanding on how a problem ought to be solved
