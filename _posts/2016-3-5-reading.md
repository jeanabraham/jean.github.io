title: Reading projects and GTD
---

On my new role, I have found the need to do a lot of reading to get up-to-speed. As a result, I had a stack of reading projects loom before me quickly, and was struggling to efficiently have a process that ensured I was getting all the reading done. My GTD system didn’t help me much either for the reasons mentioned in this [article](http://www.whatsbestnext.com/2010/06/handling-books-to-read-in-gtd/). Namely, reading projects with broken down action items along with the rest of my daily to-dos in the GTD system creates a *form of cognitive dissonance*. Hence, as the article suggests, I’ve found the distinction of working out of a routine instead of list for my reading projects to be helpful. I would rather not see a to-do entry from a reading project (say, completing a book) in my daily list at all. Instead, I have allotted times in my calendar when I can drain out the stack of ebooks on my operational reading list.

However, if it is a simple reading project/task such ‘Read through a long email chain’ or a time-sensitive one such as ‘Finish reading 30-page technical article prior to meeting’, I would still opt for the usual GTD workflow.
