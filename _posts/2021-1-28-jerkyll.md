Migrating my blog from Wordpress to Github Pages.

Steps to get the blog running locally (at http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Refer to [dependecy versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) to get the right Ruby version installed.
```
brew install ruby
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 2.7.1
rbenv local 2.7.1
gem install github-pages
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
cd yourusername.github.io
jekyll serve
```
