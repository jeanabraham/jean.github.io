title: Productivity Tips

Great [productivity tips](https://hbr.org/2015/12/9-productivity-tips-from-people-who-write-about-productivity) from Harvard Business Review. Particularly appreciated these ones:

**Tip#3: Challenge the myth of the “ideal worker.”**

Long unbroken works hours do not translate to increased productivity. Instead, incorporating restorative breaks into one’s schedule can help greatly in making a person more productive.

**Tip#4: Intentionally leave important tasks incomplete**

Counter-intuitive but sounds right. When it comes to important tasks, getting things done is not the goal, rather getting things done the best way possible is what must be aimed at.

**Tip#5: Make a habit of stepping back**

“Top performers view time off not as stalled productivity but as an investment in their future performance.” Good advice!
