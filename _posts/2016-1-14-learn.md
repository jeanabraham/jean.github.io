title: Jump on Opportunities to Learn Together
---

When it comes to learning something new, we often tend to take the approach of seeking solitude with a bunch of books and a laptop. Although this may appropriate for some kinds of learning, the collaborative approach of learning together with other people is often overlooked. HBR has an interesting article arguing that [we learn more when we learn together](https://hbr.org/2016/01/we-learn-more-when-we-learn-together). This would make sense considering that human beings are relational beings to the core and are not meant live in siloâ€™ed worlds.
