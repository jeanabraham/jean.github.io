---

Learning frequently and consistently is a must to maintain the technical vitality of an Architect, not to mention, having an enjoyable career and being an asset to your clients. Rather then seeing learning as blocking huge chunks of your time occasionaly spent on structured learning (which is also beneficial), it is better to develop habits of constant learning. One way to implement this is to create a learning bucket and allot 15 minutes every day to keep plodding through it. There are endless ways to maintain this learning bucket - a simple list, Trello, [Thoughtworks radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/how-to-byor), etc. The key is sticking to the habit of constant learning.
